    You might notice that every time we display the prompt we take the userâ€™s input and store into the class# variable. What we are doing here is called an assignment. We are setting the value of the Variable to be something so that later on we can perform calculations with it later.

    You are allowed to name your variables whatever you wish however, there are some restrictions depending on the programming language you are using and also some conventions that are widely adopted among programmers. The general restrictions are:

        <li>

        <li>
            They typically can not be characters that are not numeric, alphabetical, or under_scores.

<p>There are other types of data containers that hold a lot of data and allow you to change the information within them easily, such as Lists, Maps(trees), and Stacks. (insert examples) In fact, you can even create your own data container and allow it to hold strings and integers together. This type of programming is called object-oriented programming. The workings of them are beyond the scope of this book, so the only large data container we will use in this book is an array. Below are practical examples for you.</p>

<p>The structure Haider implemented in his code is called a decision structure. A decision structure is different from a sequence structure in that every line is not executed one after the other from top to bottom. Decision structures allow for decisions to be made on which lines of code to execute. The concept behind this flow of logic is to allow for certain segments to be run under certain conditions. Take this for instance, as Ali is walking back from school if he sees a rock in the path he walks around it. Ali walking back from school is the sequence structure as we have learned in chapter 2. He keeps walking step by step in sequential order however under the condition he sees a rock the sequence changes and he walks around it. Decision Structures can be implemented anywhere that requires a decision to be made.</p>

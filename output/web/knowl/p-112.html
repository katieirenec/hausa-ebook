<p>We have mentioned earlier that variables are changeable meaning you can change the value a variable is holding at any point in the program’s execution. What if you want to keep a variable at a constant value throughout the program? You don’t want to accidentally change it. You can then use a constant variable. A constant variable is a special type of variable that can not be changed while the program is executing. For example, let's go back to the example we were talking about earlier. Let’s assume that your school only had three classrooms, class1, class2, and class3. And the use of the total number of classrooms comes up frequently in the program implementation. We can use a constant variable in its place since.</p>

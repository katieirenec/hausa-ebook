<p>Chapter 2 gave you a good overview of what variables are, how to use them, and why they are important in programming. We have discussed when to use different types of variables such as Integer variables and String variables and how to assign and change their value. However, the types of variables we have talked about so far seem to only store one piece of information at a time. I hope you can see how this approach can be very tedious for storing lots of information. In this chapter, we will talk about other types of data containers and what it means to create your own data type. Lastly, we will close with some practice problems to help deepen your understanding.</p>

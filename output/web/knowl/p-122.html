<p>Constants are really good for cleaning up code so that it is readable and understandable to other programmers. Another way for making your programs understandable to others is by documenting and commenting on your code. Comments are descriptions of the functionality of a piece of code. There are two types of comments. Line comments and block comments. If a programmer would like to leave a comment they can do so by using the commenting symbol. It is different for each programming language, so in order to use it, reference the user guide for the programming language you are learning. In this book, the symbol for line comments in pseudocode will be “//”.</p>
